A repo where I present some of my Python scripts.

## Requirements

Python 3.10 or newer is required (find it at [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation)).

[poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry#installation) is recommended to use in this project, as the following examples assume that poetry is already installed.

## Installation

[![Open in Visual Studio Code](https://open.vscode.dev/badges/open-in-vscode.svg)](https://open.vscode.dev/minhtrancccp/miscellaneous-python)
[![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/git-%23F05033.svg?logo=git&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/minhtrancccp/miscellaneous-python.git)

You can also run this command in the root directory

```sh
poetry install
```

## Testing

Run the following command in the `tests/` directory

```sh
poetry run pytest
```

## Documentation

As [the repo's Read the Doc site](https://miscellaneous-python.readthedocs.io/) is to be updated, please kindly use the docstring within scripts instead.
